# Archipelago Integration for Oblivion Remastered

A UE4SS and .esp mod that randomizes Oblivion's 15 Daedric shrine quests for [Archipelago multiworld](https://archipelago.gg/). 

Players receive shrine unlock tokens to access quests, then send completion status back to the multiworld when shrine quests are completed.

## To install:

### The ue4ss mod 

Place `ue4ss` in `\Oblivion Remastered\OblivionRemastered\Binaries\Win64\`

ue4ss mods currently do not work with mod managers and must be placed directly in the above location

### The .esp mod

Place `Archipelago_Oblivion.esp` in `\Oblivion Remastered\OblivionRemastered\Content\Dev\ObvData\Data`

or if you use a mod manager, just make sure your filetree looks like this:
