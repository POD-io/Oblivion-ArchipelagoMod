# Archipelago Integration for Oblivion Remastered

A UE4SS and .esp mod that randomizes Oblivion's 15 Daedric shrine quests for [Archipelago multiworld](https://archipelago.gg/). 

Players receive shrine unlock tokens to access quests, then send completion status back to the multiworld when shrine quests are completed.
